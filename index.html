        <h4>Baramati Government Hospital, Baramati. 
            (Client: V Cube Engineering Pvt Ltd)</h4>
        <p>The project focused on internal electrification, including conducting,
            wiring, installation of fittings, and maintenance, ensuring efficiency
            and safety. A significant task was testing and commissioning 33 KV 
            high tension panels, documented thoroughly in reports. Additionally, 
            we executed low tension cable laying and precise termination, meeting 
            stringent specifications for secure and reliable electrical distribution.</p>

        <h4>Sasoon Hospital, Pune. (Client: V Cube Engineering Pvt Ltd, 
            Sanjivani Electricals)</h4>
        <p>The project covered extensive internal electrification, including conduiting, 
           wiring, and fittings, complemented by maintenance for sustained performance.
            We installed a substation HT & LT panel and four 1250 KVA diesel generators,
            providing reliable power backup. Additionally, the project involved setting
            up and commissioning street light poles, enhancing outdoor lighting and 
            safety. This integrated approach ensured efficient electrical distribution 
            and improved infrastructure.</p>

        <h4>Amar Madhuban Tech Park, Pune (Client: Madhuban Inn Pvt Ltd, Shalaka Infra tech Pvt Ltd)</h4>
        <p>The project involved a series of electrical engineering initiatives, including the 
            setup of 22 KV solar and non-solar HT & LT substations, complemented by internal 
            electrification efforts. It featured the design and installation of cafeteria lighting,
             the execution of an AMC for electrical equipment, and the deployment of three 630 KVA 
             diesel generators. Additionally, it included the shifting of a 22 KV line from 
             overhead to underground and comprehensive electrical renovation, enhancing both 
             the functionality and safety of the facility's electrical infrastructure.</p>
